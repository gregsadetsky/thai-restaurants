# Thai Restaurants

This is a list of Thai Restaurants approved (recommended?) by the Thai Government.

If you go to https://thaiselect.com/ , you will see:

*"Thai SELECT is a mark of certification awarded by the Ministry of Commerce [of] The Royal Thai Government to guarantee the authentic Thai taste of Thai food products and Thai restaurants in Thailand and overseas"*

That site has a list of restaurants, but no map. I also wanted to make a backup of the restaurants. I also just like making maps!
